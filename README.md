# COVID-19-severity-prediction

This project aims to develop predictive models using various machine learning algorithms to classify the severity of COVID-19 cases in Malaysia. The best-performing model will be implemented in a Streamlit web application for healthcare professionals. The project seeks to provide a reliable and efficient tool to rapidly assess COVID-19 patient severity in the context of the ongoing pandemic.

Objectives:
1. Develop predictive models using machine learning.
2. Evaluate and select the best model for COVID-19 severity classification.
3. Present the results through a user-friendly web application.

Methodology:
1. Collect and preprocess COVID-19 patient data.
2. Engineer relevant features.
3. Build and evaluate multiple machine learning models.
4. Optimize the best-performing model.
5. Develop a Streamlit web application for displaying results.

Conclusion:
The project will deliver a valuable tool for healthcare professionals to assess COVID-19 patient severity effectively, contributing to improved resource allocation and patient care in Malaysia. Future work may involve model refinement and real-time data integration.
